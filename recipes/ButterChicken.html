  <h3> Ingredients </h3>
  <ul>
    <li>1 lb boneless, skinless chicken breasts, cut into small pieces</li>
    <li>1/2 cup plain yogurt</li>
    <li>1 tbsp grated ginger</li>
    <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
    <li>1 tbsp garam masala</li>
    <li>1 tsp cumin</li>
    <li>1 tsp turmeric</li>
    <li>1 tsp chili powder</li>
    <li>2 tbsp butter</li>
    <li>1 onion, chopped</li>
    <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
    <li>1 tbsp grated ginger</li>
    <li>1 tbsp garam masala</li>
    <li>1 tsp cumin</li>
    <li>1 tsp turmeric</li>
    <li>1 tsp chili powder</li>
    <li>1 can (14 oz) crushed tomatoes</li>
    <li>1 cup heavy cream</li>
    <li>Salt, to taste</li>
    <li>Chopped fresh cilantro, for garnish</li>

  </ul>
  <h3> Steps </h3>
  <ol>
    <li>In a large bowl, mix together the chicken, yogurt, ginger, garlic, garam masala, cumin, turmeric, and chili
      powder. Cover the bowl and refrigerate for at least 1 hour, or overnight.</li>
    <li>Preheat the oven to 400°F (200°C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper and arrange the marinated chicken
      pieces on the sheet. Bake for 15-20 minutes, or until cooked through.</li>
    <li>In a large saucepan, melt the butter over medium heat. Add the onion, garlic, and ginger and cook until the
      onion is soft and translucent, about 5 minutes.</li>
    <li>Add the garam masala, cumin, turmeric, and chili powder to the saucepan and cook for another 2 minutes, stirring
      constantly.</li>
    <li>Add the crushed tomatoes and simmer for 10-15 minutes, until the sauce has thickened slightly.</li>
    <li>Add the cooked chicken to the saucepan and stir to coat it in the tomato sauce.</li>
    <li>Stir in the heavy cream and simmer for another 5-10 minutes, until the sauce has thickened and the chicken is
      cooked through.</li>
    <li>Season with salt to taste, and garnish with chopped cilantro before serving.</li>
