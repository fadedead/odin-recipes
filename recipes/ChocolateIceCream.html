  <h3> Ingredients </h3>
  <ul>
    <li>2 cups heavy cream</li>
    <li>1 cup whole milk</li>
    <li>3/4 cup granulated sugar</li>
    <li>1/2 cup unsweetened cocoa powder</li>
    <li>4 large egg yolks</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
  </ul>
  <h3> Steps </h3>
  <ol>
    <li>In a medium saucepan, whisk together the heavy cream, milk, sugar, and cocoa powder until smooth. Heat the
      mixture over medium heat, stirring frequently, until it reaches a simmer.</li>
    <li>In a separate bowl, whisk together the egg yolks until smooth. Slowly pour about 1 cup of the hot cream mixture
      into the egg yolks, whisking constantly, to temper the yolks and prevent them from curdling.</li>
    <li>Pour the egg mixture back into the saucepan with the remaining cream mixture and whisk to combine.</li>
    <li>Cook the mixture over medium heat, stirring constantly, until it thickens and coats the back of a spoon, about
      5-7 minutes. Do not let the mixture boil.</li>
    <li>Remove the saucepan from heat and stir in the vanilla extract.</li>
    <li>Strain the mixture through a fine-mesh sieve into a large bowl, then cover and refrigerate until chilled, at
      least 2 hours or overnight.</li>
    <li>Once the mixture is chilled, pour it into an ice cream maker and churn according to the manufacturer's
      instructions until it is thick and creamy, usually about 20-25 minutes.</li>
    <li>Transfer the ice cream to a freezer-safe container and freeze until firm, at least 4 hours or overnight, before
      serving.</li>
    <li>Serve and enjoy!</li>
  </ol>
